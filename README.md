# Backbit

**Backbit** is an open source, modular backup and messaging system designed to handle automated, event-driven backups across multiple services and technologies.

It is built to be extensible, developer-friendly, and independent of cloud providers. The initial implementation focuses on MySQL backups, with support for more data sources planned in future releases.
